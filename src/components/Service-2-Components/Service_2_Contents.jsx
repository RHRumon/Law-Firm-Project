            Why Family Law Matters:
          </h1>
          <p className="text-base md:leading-[27px] text-[#3A3D3F] work-sans">
            Family law is not just about legal proceedings; itâ€™s about
            addressing deeply personal and emotional matters. A family lawyer
            acts as both an advocate and a counselor, helping clients navigate
            their challenges with empathy and precision. They aim to secure the
            best outcomes while minimizing emotional and financial strain.
